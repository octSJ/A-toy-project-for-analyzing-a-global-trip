# A-toy-project-for-analyzing-a-global-trip
In this simple toy project we are going to analyze a trip to 10 major cities all around the globe.
In this notenook file I have listed some of the most visited tourist spots and the corresponding costs like flight cost, hotel cost and cost for renting cars. Then I asked 2 questions and tried to answer them through the output of my code. My main goal was to analyze the trip with respect to the input total budget.
First of all the code calculates the total budgets against the cities and at last it analyzes and outputs the preference of the cities according to the total budget. It lists down the cities in order of least expensive to most expensive. It also lists down the cities which are out of the total budget.
Most importantly there are some constraints to this analysis which are listed on top of the notebook.
